    "- Simple random sampling with replacement: In simple random sampling with replacement, for the creation of a sample size n, you select an element from the population and then return it to the population. This procedure is repeated n times. Thus, each element of the population can be selected more than once in a sample. This is used when the population size is small.\n",
    "- Simple random sampling without replacement: In simple random sampling without replacement, for the creation of a sample size n, you select an element from the population and don’t return it to the population. The selection of elements from the population is repeated n times. This is used when the population size is large.\n",
    "- Stratified random sampling: In stratified random sampling, the population is divided into strata on the basis of common characteristics. The elements are then selected from these strata.\n",
    "- Cluster sampling: In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters, and then, a simple random sample of these clusters is selected.\n",
    "Systematic sampling: In systematic sampling, a starting point is selected in the population, and then, the elements are selected at regular, fixed intervals.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-random sampling**: In this kind of sampling, each element of the population does not have the same probability of getting selected in the sample.\n",
    "- Convenience sampling: In convenience sampling, the researcher selects the elements from the population on the basis of the convenient accessibility of these elements.\n",
    "Judgemental sampling: In judgemental sampling, the researcher selects the elements on the basis of his judgement and bias.\n",
    "- Quota sampling: The population is divided into groups or quotas, on the basis of which you select the sample. Quota sampling is, to a certain extent, similar to random sampling; the sampling procedure is more or less the same in both the cases, except the quota is fixed in quota sampling. That is,  you don't consider the entire population, just a section of it to create a quota.\n",
    "- Snowball sampling: In the case of snowball sampling, a small sample is first selected, say a sample of five people. Then, each of the five members can suggest five names, and those five can suggest five more each. This creates a snowball effect."
