    "### **Q2. Why do we consider using inferential statistics when we have understood a data sample using descriptive statistics?**\n",
    " **Ans**. 1.Descriptive Statistics is a discipline which is concerned with describing the population under study. Inferential Statistics is a type of statistics that focuses on   drawing conclusions about the population, on the basis of sample analysis and observation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.Descriptive Statistics collects, organises, analyzes and presents data in a meaningful way. On the contrary, Inferential Statistics, compares data, test hypothesis and make predictions of the future outcomes."

    "### **Q3. H0=> avg battery life<=1year,H1=> avg battery life>1 year. Which type of error would you like to minimise here-Type1 or Type2?Should we use high confidence interval or lower?**\n",
    " **Ans**. TYPE-1 Error-- if we incorrectly reject a null hypothesis when its correct ie H0 -- true and still we reject it.\n",
    "         TYPE-2 ERROR-- if we fail to reject the null hypothesis when its incorrect ie H0 -- false and still we dont reject it.\n",

    "       - Here we will minimise Type-I error because if the battery life < 1 year and still we reject it ,it may cause loss of life for the patients.\n",
    "       - The confidence is given by 1-a so to maximize confidence we must minimise a hence confidence interval should be higher around 99%."

    "### **Q4. Lets say you work for an e comm company and want to check whether changing the color of the go-kart button of your website from blue to green increases the conversion rates of visitors to become customers or not?**\n",
    " **Ans**. A/B Testing is trying to achieve a better user experience for a customer. This can lead to an increased conversion rate. We can divide our customer base into **control and Variation groups**. The variation group can then further be divided into 2 further groups where the change is implanted and where it is kept as the current. We can then compare the data as to how many people buy the products of the website and form a conclusion as to if there is any effect of the change in the color of the Go TO Cart button.\n",
    " \n",
    " - In the above method the target or variation group is exposed to the change whereas control group is not exposed to the change.\n",
    " - Assign 0 if he didnt become the customer and 1 if he becomes the customer.\n",
    " - **Hypothesis** H0-Change in the button didnt convert any customer ,H1 = opp\n",
    " - We will use 2 sample proportion test for this one\n",
    " - Reject the hypothesis according to the p-value."
